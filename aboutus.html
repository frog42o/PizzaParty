        <p class = "lead fw-normal">We came together to create this website with a goal to boost online learning engagement. We hope to eliminate the toxicity in creating a competitive environment, instead encouraging the sense of community and collective effort in the classroom in order to keep everyone on the same page.</p>

            I'm Su Jin and I'm currently a student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science. 
            I plan on graduating in 2025 and my current interests involve UI/UX Design, Front-end Development, Software Development, cybersecurity, and the cloud. 
            Still in the process of exploring the vast field of computer science, I hope to expand my experience through indepndent exploration and collaboration with the surrounding computer science community at UVA. 
            Outside of my education, I love to play basketball, bake, draw, and immerse myself in the various CIO's throughout the school including Korean Student Association and Girls Who Code.
            If you have any questions about me or any of my projects, feel free to contact me through email!
