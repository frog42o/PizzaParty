            I'm Su Jin and I'm currently a student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science. 
            I plan on graduating in 2025 and my current interests involve UI/UX Design, Front-end Development, Software Development, cybersecurity, and the cloud. 
            Still in the process of exploring the vast field of computer science, I hope to expand my experience through independent exploration and collaboration with the surrounding computer science community at UVA. 
            Outside of my education, I love to play basketball, bake, draw, and immerse myself in the various CIO's throughout the school including Korean Student Association and Girls Who Code.

            Hello, my name is Sam Gausmann. 
            I am currently a freshman studying entrepreneurship at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. 
            As an Eagle Scout and Division One athlete, I have developed a strong work ethic and a passion for excellence that drives me to pursue opportunities to provide value to others. 
            In addition to my studies, I have successfully launched and managed two vintage clothing businesses, which has further fueled my passion for entrepreneurship.
